# Weather-Journal App Project.
This project is to practice creating an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Project description.
 * I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
 * The web app fetch data from a weather app.
 * I added a pop-up alert to alarm the user if the input zip code is not valid.
 * If valid the app then send part of the fetched data back to the server adding date and user input data along with it.
 * The new data is stored in server and then sent back from the server to the client.
 * The newly recieved data is then used to modify the UI.
 * I modified the CSS just a little to make the displayed page more distinguishable.
 * I wrote soome comments to make the code more readable.


## Instructions on how to run the project.
* To use the web app all you have to do is enter the zip code of any city in the united states.
(optional) You can write your feelings.
* The web App will then show you the following:
  - the date.
  - the temperature in the city corresponding to the zip code you entered.
  - your feelings(if entered by the user).



## Dependencies. 
* The project uses 'express','body-parser' and 'cors' packages of node.js.
